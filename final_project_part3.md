## Process Review

**Part I**

In [part I](/final_project_part1.md), I started my draft of the final project by conducting research, collecting dataset, and creating initial sketches of the data visualizations. In order to identify the ideal food that is minimally processed and quick to make, I researched what foods are deemed ultra processed in our society for this project. Additionally, I investigated the impact that highly processed foods do to our bodies. To make the storytelling structure more smooth and convincing, I finalized the Setup, Conflict, and Resolution parts.

* Setup: Our daily diet comprises a significant number of highly processed foods. Eating foods that are highly processed has been linked by researchers to an increase in cardiovascular disorders.

* Conflict: The majority of people are aware of the need of eating well, yet frequently they are unsure of exactly what constitutes a healthy diet. Additionally, graduate students may not have a sufficient amount of time or many options for healthy foods.

* Resolution: In this assignment, a variety of quick-to-prepare, healthful, or minimally processed food options will be researched and presented.

**Data/Information Utilized**

1. The typical food intake breakdown for college students from a survey conducted among 161 university students at the University of Girona.
2. Amount of students who are aware of the concept of processed foods from another survey conducted among 161 university students at the University of Girona.
3. How many calories the most common types of foods contain per gram from the _Natural & Ultra-Processed Foods (NUPF) database_.
4. A method to differentiate and tell whether a certain type of food is processed or not provided by Harvard Health.
5. Clinical and translational report _Ultra-Processed Diets Cause Excess Calorie Intake and Weight Gain: An Inpatient Randomized Controlled Trial of Ad Libitum Food Intake_ which includes a comparison between a diet presented to the subjects with ultra-Processed and unprocessed foods.

**Part II**

In [Part II](/final_project_part2.md), I created a set of wireframes of how I want to pan out the presentation and a Shorthand presentation based on my wireframes and data visualizations. I have also narrowed down my target audience - CMU students like myself. Due to the fact that college students lack the time to prepare meals and must instead rely on unhealthy foods to get through the day, my issue is most applicable to them, according to the results of my user research. Finding my audience and adapting the narrative to suit their interests and interests was one of the most significant improvements in this part. I conducted interviews to learn more about the audience for my story and how to make it interesting and educational for them. The user research also provided more suggestions for me to revise my visualizations.

I have also conducted more research during this part on dataset and read more scholarly works to gain insights on my topic. 

**Part III**

I've changed a few things in my final data story since [Part II](/final_project_part2.md) was finished. 

I modified the data and visualizations I utilized for the story. After reviewing the findings from my interviews, I came to the conclusion that my initial data set—the "Natural & Ultra-Processed Foods database"—was not as pertinent to my target audience as I had originally believed. Only "healthiness" and other nutrition information about each type of food were included in this dataset, which is important in highlighting how unhealthy ultra-processed foods are but did not offer any additional insights into how frequently and why people tend to consume them.

Then I made the decision to change course and use a different data set that was more closely related to the topics that interested my audience. In order to develop new visualizations that effectively communicated the most important ideas and discoveries from the data, I had to conduct further research and analysis. I perused a number of academic publications, such as Ultra-processed foods among university students: Implementing Nutri-Score to make healthy choices, to gather information on the consumption of ultra-processed foods among college students.

I had to make a number of design choices during the process to make sure my story was understandable, concise, and visually appealing. To get the perfect mix between clarity and impact, I experimented with several chart types and layout options. To make the story more interesting and simple to grasp, I also spent a lot of time editing the wording and language.

Working on this project made me realize how crucial it is to keep the audience in mind when developing a data story. To be truly effective, the story must be tailored to the audience's interests and requirements and not just simply deliver the data and findings. I was able to better understand my audience and develop a story that resonated with them through conducting interviews.
