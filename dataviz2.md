## My takeaway

<p>I was able to highlight various components of the same general government debt data and show the audience various aspects of the data by using different visualization techniques.</p>
<p>By comparing the government debt of multiple countries in the year 2021 using a bar chart, I can make the comparison between countries incredibly simple and apparent.</p>

<p>By switching to a grid of line charts, I was able to display the trend and changes that occurred in each country from 1995 to 2019 in a single graphic, allowing viewers to compare the trends between them. The audience can hover their cursor over the line chart to see the corresponding statistics if they want to concentrate on just one particular year. As a result, the line chart was able to display the audience the trend of the data at a high level in addition to clearly presenting the audience with the data points.</p>
<p>I decided to utilize a pie chart with a time slider for the third visualization. The audience can choose the year they want to examine by using the time slider on this pie chart. Additionally, this chart contains an animation function that enables users to easily observe the dynamic changes in government debt proportions across all countries from 1995 to 2021 by clicking the "Play" button. This feature gives viewers a comprehensive understanding of the data.</p>
