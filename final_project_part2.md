## Wireframes
I created a set of wireframes of how I want to pan out the presentation. 

![Group 23](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107513376/204947537-95d9fe38-6601-43d6-9014-4776ae9b6c9e.png)

## Shorthand

I created a Shorthand presentation based on my wireframes and data visualizations.

### Setup

This is the setup part. I will introduce some common food options and show the audiences what kind of processed food categories they fall into. Sometimes, the result could be quite surprising - and that is exactly how I can draw audiences' attention.

![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107513376/204961060-ad8c24d8-a285-4f80-8a93-3627e207d1d8.PNG)

### Conflict

I present the audience with numerous data visualizations in this section. I'll start by showing how many of the meals that students like myself consume on a daily basis are bad and why. The effects of highly processed meals will be discussed with the audience, and the fact that few people are aware of this problem will be stressed.

### Resolution

This is the resolution part. I'll demonstrate to the audience in this section how we can still eat healthily while also saving time. I'll teach the audience how to recognize ultra-processed foods from other categories, how to read ingredient lists to stay away from harmful ones, and how to make quick, wholesome meals at home.

## User Research

Here are the aspects I wanted to get user feedback on and corresponding questions.

![Interview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107513376/204932420-31a80edc-10ad-4987-8db6-f376a91161f2.jpg)

Here are the summary of feedback from 2 users. Based on the user feedback, I found that the narrative structure, color scheme, and layout are all well-received and I will continue following the current methods.

### Possible improvements for Part III
One user mentioned that the font sizes on the visualizations are not visible enough. I will try to mitigate and improve on that in Part III. 
Besides this, I will continue researching for data set and create visualizations to support my presentation.
