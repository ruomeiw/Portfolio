# Final Project - Part I
## Project Outline
In our life, food is essential. Every day, we look forward to breakfast to get the day started; lunch turns food and drink into a lively and productive afternoon; and dinner with friends or family brings an end to the day's hassles. Have you ever considered how processed the meal you just ate is, though? Was it nutritious? What changes will it make to your body?

Our days as graduate students are quite hectic. Many of us do not have the time to plan our meals, much less eat healthily. To keep our stomachs full and get through the day, we rely on snacks, prepackaged or canned food, and frozen dinners. Every time I place a frozen dinner into my microwave and watch it rotate, I can't help but think about how industrialized this food is. I sincerely wish I knew more about how to choose nutritious foods while still shortening the cooking process.

In order to identify the ideal food that is minimally processed and quick to make, I am examining what foods are deemed ultra processed in our society for this project. Additionally, I'd like to investigate the impact that highly processed foods do to our bodies.

* Setup: Our daily diet comprises a significant number of highly processed foods. Eating foods that are highly processed has been linked by researchers to an increase in cardiovascular disorders.

* Conflict: The majority of people are aware of the need of eating well, yet frequently they are unsure of exactly what constitutes a healthy diet. Additionally, graduate students may not have a sufficient amount of time or many options for healthy foods.

* Resolution: In this assignment, a variety of quick-to-prepare, healthful, or minimally processed food options will be researched and presented.

## Initial sketches
* **Setup**

First, I will show everyone the typical food intake breakdown for college students from a survey conducted among 161 university students at the University of Girona. 

<img width="1149" alt="Sketch_Breakdown" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107513376/203689647-7973969b-e8de-4c85-81f2-0f95616d2be4.PNG">

* **Conflict**

Now in the Conflict part, I will focus on revealing the differences between ultra-processed foods and healthy foods. To start with, I will showcase how these processed foods would impact our health by showing two graphs: The first one tells us that unprocessed foods give us more energy.

<img width="898" alt="Sketch_MoreEnergy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107513376/203669219-a365d105-1ff5-49ac-8c82-c23b0b172894.PNG">

The second graph tells us that unprocessed foods would help us reduce weight, while ultra-processed foods only make us gain weight.

<img width="897" alt="Sketch_ReducesWeight" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107513376/203669342-c43b0f60-d327-483b-9954-0992c39975b6.PNG">

Now this graph is used to show the audience that still many students, like us, do not have sufficient awareness of how to eat well. The data is from another survey conducted among 161 university students at the University of Girona.

<img width="1334" alt="Sketch_Awareness" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107513376/203669629-0a1d8455-2a65-4efd-9126-42a383d02ee7.PNG">

At this point, the audience should be intrigued to gain more awareness about this issue and would like to know how to tell the differences between these foods. 
I would like to inform students how many calories these foods contain per gram, and present with a visualization that could show the differences in a more straighforward way. The data is collected from the Natural & Ultra-Processed Foods (NUPF) database. I will elaborate on this graph to make it more clear and simplistic as my research progresses.

<img width="747" alt="Sketch_Calories" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107513376/203670035-772611c8-12b6-4811-80ff-0af86f976ab7.PNG">

* **Resolution**

In the Resolution part, I aim to demonstrate students some techniques of how to pick less processed food, and develop a healthy diet by showing how to read ingredient labels. Now, I will demonstrate a method to differentiate and tell whether a certain type of food is processed or not. This method is provided by Harvard Health.

<img width="771" alt="Sketch_Difference" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107513376/203670426-022cfe2a-f85a-45d6-a922-557d4737c01e.PNG">

After showing everyone how to tell them apart, I will present a more detailed graph of the foods and recommend people of the healthiest foods.

<img width="902" alt="Sketch_IntroList" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107513376/203675360-8153ce00-6f3a-4b9a-92eb-2a03c60bfbe8.PNG">

Lastly, I will teach some tricks to let students know how to be on the lookout for artificial ingredients that we should avoid.

<img width="1458" alt="Sketch_ReadLabels" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107513376/203679404-2cd20baa-4343-4f8d-abd9-1c8a88c801b1.PNG">

## Data
Here are the data sources I used for this project.
> Natural & Ultra-Processed Foods (NUPF) database
> 
> [Link to the database](https://zenodo.org/record/4601555#.Y37X8XbMIuU)

This public dataset contains information on 40 different types of foods, such as their caloric content, healthiness, and many other features. I will create food calorie and healthiness visualizations using this data source to help clarify what types of foods are healthier and what types we should stay away from. The features of popularity and appeal can also be used to determine which meals are the most difficult to give up and how to avoid them more effectively.

> [Link to the report](https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/pdf/S1550-4131(19)30248-7.pdf)

This is a clinical and translational report about cell metabolism. This report has many charts and data that could be used for this project. The data are very clinical and detailed, including a comparison between a diet presented to the subjects with ultra-Processed and unprocessed foods, graphs about the changes in energy intake, body weight, fat mass, energy expenditure (sleeping and sedentary), physical activity expenditure, and daily CO2 production. This clinical research also tracks the changes in glucose and insulin during the ultra-processed and unprocessed diet periods.

This scholarly paper examined the dietary habits of college students, focusing on the types of ultra-processed foods they are most likely to choose to eat and their motivations. Numerous survey results about college students' dining preferences are included in this report. The data in this research would be very beneficial if I decide to develop visualizations on varied perspectives and food choices between males and females because the survey results include include differences for male and female students.

## Method and medium

For the final project presentation, I will use Shorthand to create a smooth and visually pleasing experience for my audience. I will use Tableau and Flourish to create the data visualizations since they produce engaging animations and interactive features that draw people in. I would probably use Figma to create some elegant and straightforward graphs that have more text than the other visuals.
