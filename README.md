# Portfolio
This is my portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!

# About me
Hi, welcome to my portfolio! I am Della Wang (she/her/hers), a MISM student at CMU. Throughout my time here, I have been increasingly interested in web development, software engineering, and essentially everything else that involves coding. Fortunately, I will work as a full-time software engineer at The Real Real once I graduate, fulfilling a lifelong dream of mine. Working for a firm that combines my two greatest passions, fashion and technology, makes me feel extremely content and appreciated! I can't wait to show the world that beauty, femininity, and technology are never incompatible!

# What I hope to learn
Using all the available powerful tools, I wish to learn how to properly and compellingly visualize data.
Furthermore, I'm constantly interested in learning new ways to make technology, data, and even code more visually appealing because I firmly believe that beauty and technology are not mutually exclusive. The ability to effectively represent my beliefs, my community (female engineers, underrepresented people in tech, etc.), and myself is what I most want to learn. 

# Portfolio
All my works will be shown here. Stay tuned :)
