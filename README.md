# Telling Stories with Data

This is my portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!

## About me

Hi, welcome to my portfolio! I am Della Wang (she/her/hers), a MISM student at CMU. Throughout my time here, I have been increasingly interested in web development, software engineering, and essentially everything else that involves coding. Fortunately, I will work as a full-time software engineer at The Real Real once I graduate, fulfilling a lifelong dream of mine. Working for a firm that combines my two greatest passions, fashion and technology, makes me feel extremely content and appreciated! I can't wait to show the world that beauty, femininity, and technology are never incompatible!

## What I hope to learn

Using all the available powerful tools, I wish to learn how to properly and compellingly visualize data.
Furthermore, I'm constantly interested in learning new ways to make technology, data, and even code more visually appealing because I firmly believe that beauty and technology are not mutually exclusive. The ability to effectively represent my beliefs, my community (female engineers, underrepresented people in tech, etc.), and myself is what I most want to learn. 


## My Works

[General government debt](/dataviz2.md)

In this assignment, I was able to highlight various components of the same general government debt data and show the audience various aspects of the data by using different visualization techniques.

[Critique by Design](/CritiquebyDesign.md)

In this assignment, I discovered a data visualization that is already fantastic, but I think it could be even better. Using the Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile, I am able to define and discuss what is missing in this visualization. I analyzed the raw data, conducted user research, and recreated this visualization using different techniques.
